# GOMPact

**GOMPact** is a web-based platform designed to bridge the gap between Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and volunteers during critical windows of disaster response.

This project was developed during **Bluehacks 2025**, a hackathon hosted by **ADMU's COMPSAT**, marking my first-ever hackathon experience.

## 🏆 Hackathon Challenge

The project was built under the themes of **SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities** and **Disaster Risk Response**. In the Philippines, the speed of mobilization can save lives. GOMPact focuses on "compacting" the time it takes for NGOs to find verified, ready-to-help volunteers when a disaster strikes.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Volunteer Matching:** A streamlined interface for NGOs to post urgent needs and for volunteers to sign up for specific disaster response roles.
* **NGO-Centric Hub:** A dashboard view for organizations to manage their active relief operations and track volunteer counts.
* **Responsive Resource Directory:** A quick-access layout providing essential information for disaster preparedness and response.

## 💻 Tech Stack

Since this was my introduction to competitive coding and rapid prototyping, the project is built using the foundational pillars of web development:

* **HTML5:** Structural layout for the platform.
* **CSS3:** Custom styling to ensure a clean, urgent, and professional user interface.
* **JavaScript:** Client-side interactivity and navigation.

## 📂 Project Origins

This repository serves as a memento of my first hackathon. While the project is a frontend-only prototype, it represents the beginning of my journey in building technology that addresses social issues and community resilience.
